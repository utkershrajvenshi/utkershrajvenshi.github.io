# Utkersh Rajvenshi
#### Caffeine-fueled frontend maniac :)

Hi visitors, I have been professionally involved with frontend development for more than an year now, even though my tryst with pixel-accurate designs goes back to my college days when I fell in love with the Flutter framework. Sadly, we are on a hiatus right now as I have become measurably-competent in the world of React and its never-ending useState and useEffect loops ü•≤
Not to mention, I have gotten better at resolving bugs arising due to themüèã

If this iteration interests you or if you got any suggestions for yours truly, we can hold a discussion over [e-mail](mailto:utkarshrajvanshi2@gmail.com), [X (formerly Twitter)](https://twitter.com/UtkarshRajvansh) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/utkersh-rajvenshi-78738a1b0/)

Anyways, let's move on to the other juicy parts of this markdown document/resume/to-be-beautified-portfolio site‚ú®

## Experience

### Developer, IDFC FIRST Bank (July 2022-Present)
Been associated with this organization since straight after my graduation. I have been a part of the UI team developing an internal product for easier, streamlined workflows for our customer-facing bank employees. Together with our friends from the backend team, we have been able to reduce reliance on third-party tools to reduce cost overheads in large, and develop processes to make the day-to-day operations as the targeted end-user as frictionless as possible.

As a UI engineer so far at IDFC FIRST Bank,

 - I have grown proficient in **React**
 - Made our code more type-safe and relatively easier to debug using **TypeScript**
 - Made sure we pass code-compliance by maintaining great test coverage with **Jest**
 - Coordinated discussions with platform engineering teams to make our **GoCD** build pipeline faster and more efficient
 - Optimised our bundle using **webpack** configurations


### Open Source Contributor, freeCodeCamp/atSign (October 2022)
As part of Hacktoberfest 2022, made contributions to the repositories of two close repos to me, freeCodeCamp(owe a lot of my learning to this amazing community) and atSign(the sponsor of the first open source event I attended, OpenForce 2022).
My contributions were very trivial at the time. Fixing css styles, accessibility text and documentation fixes basically summarise my contributions to these repos. As an individual contributor, I would strive to revisit them in time to make more meaningful contributions to these projects.

## Personal Projects

### Portfolio site(October 2023 - Now)
This is the latest personal project I am currently working on. For iteration one, this project is made on GitHub pages and simply renders a markdown document. Until iteration two hits my main objectives for this site are to host it outside GitHub pages, and employ system design principles to support it independently using cloud provider GCP.

### FindMyFamily, a group location-tracking application (2022 - TBD), [link](https://github.com/utkershrajvenshi/findmyfamily)
Started this project as an entry for DEV Community + Appwrite International Hackathon 2022. It's a Flutter application that is an open-source alternative to popular group-tracking apps like Life360 and uses Appwrite as a self-hosted backend and features persistent location-sharing among a group of users. Major services proposed to be used are Appwrite‚Äôs Realtime Database, Accounts API, Cloud Functions and Storage. Currently on an indefinite break on active development.

### REST API abstraction for WebRTC client backend (April 2022), [link](https://github.com/utkershrajvenshi/webrtc-rest-api)
Worked on this project to learn about backend development using Python/Flask.It's a RESTful backend API to accompany an Agora WebRTC application to-be built with VueJS or NextJS(open to learning both). The CRUD API is closely integrated with SQLAlchemy, Marshmallow packages in Flask micro-framework. The API employs
storing of user information on a local SQLite3 database and randomized key generation for developers to
discourage abuse and corruption of database and to implement features like rate-limiting and activity tracking. Learned key skills:

 - Postman API testing
 - Flask SQLAlchemy integration
 - Serialization and de-serialization of data
 - SHA256 hashing
