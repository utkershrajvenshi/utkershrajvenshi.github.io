This section showcases the projects I have pursued recently.

## Portfolio site(October 2023-Present)

This is the latest personal project I am currently working on. Currently in iteration two, this project displays simple markdown documents using MkDocs static site generator.

The site is also containerized using Docker and deployed on Google Cloud Platform with basic system design principles. Also planned for this iteration is to construct a backend system that allows for updating site content without the author manually modifying the markdown documents.

## FindMyFamily, a group location-tracking application (2022-TBD), [link](https://github.com/utkershrajvenshi/findmyfamily)

Started this project while in college as an entry for DEV Community + Appwrite International Hackathon 2022.

It's a Flutter application that is an open-source alternative to popular group-tracking apps like Life360 and uses Appwrite as a self-hosted backend and features persistent location-sharing among a group of users. Major services proposed to be used are Appwriteâ€™s Realtime Database, Accounts API, Cloud Functions, and Storage.

Currently on an indefinite break on active development due to professional commitments.

## REST API abstraction for WebRTC client backend (April 2022), [link](https://github.com/utkershrajvenshi/webrtc-rest-api)

Worked on this project to learn about backend development using Python/Flask. It's a RESTful backend API to accompany an Agora WebRTC application to be built with VueJS or NextJS(open to learning both).

The CRUD API is closely integrated with SQLAlchemy and Marshmallow packages in the Flask micro-framework. The API employs storing of user information on a local SQLite3 database and randomized key generation for developers to discourage abuse and corruption of the database and to implement features like rate-limiting and activity tracking.

Learned key skills:

* Postman API testing
* Flask SQLAlchemy integration
* Serialization and de-serialization of data
* SHA256 hashing
