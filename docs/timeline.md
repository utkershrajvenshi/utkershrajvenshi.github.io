# Experience

## Developer, IDFC FIRST Bank (July 2022-Present)

Been associated with this organization since straight after my graduation. I have been a part of the UI team developing an internal product for easier, streamlined workflows for our customer-facing bank employees.

Together with our friends from the backend team, we have been able to reduce reliance on third-party tools to reduce cost overheads at large and develop processes to make the day-to-day operations of the targeted end-user as frictionless as possible.

As a UI engineer so far at IDFC FIRST Bank,

* I have grown proficient in **React**
* Made our code more type-safe and relatively easier to debug using **TypeScript**
* Made sure we passed code compliance by maintaining great test coverage with **Jest**
* Coordinated discussions with platform engineering teams to make our **GoCD** build pipeline faster and more efficient
* Optimised our bundle using **webpack** configurations

## Open Source Contributor, freeCodeCamp/atSign (October 2022)

As part of Hacktoberfest 2022, made contributions to the repositories of two projects close to me, freeCodeCamp and atSign.

My contributions were very trivial at the time. Fixing CSS styles, accessibility text and documentation fixes basically summarise my contributions to these repos. As an individual contributor, I would strive to revisit them in time to make more meaningful contributions to these projects.
